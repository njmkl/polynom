While exploring numerical and neural approaches to the **quintic equation**,  
I came across an excellent article in the *Notices of the American Mathematical Society*:  
[**“The Quintic, the Icosahedron, and Elliptic Curves”**](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202404/noti2923/noti2923.html)  
by **Bruce Bartlett (2024)**.  
It beautifully explains the mathematical background of the quintic problem —  
this project looks at it from a **machine learning** perspective.

### 📁 Repository Structure

- **`polynome.ipynb`** — final Jupyter notebook with the complete neural–numerical solution.  
- **`quintic_dataset.csv`** — final version of the synthetic dataset used for training and validation.  
- **`experiments/`** — contains experimental datasets and earlier scripts from previous tests and model prototypes.
